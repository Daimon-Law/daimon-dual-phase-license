### Preamble

The Daimon Dual-Phase License (DDPL) is a time-bound, dual phase, copyleft‐style license for software and other works, specifically crafted to foster early-stage collaboration and allow more permissive use after a period of time has elapsed, as determined by the licensor.

Most licenses for software and practical works are designed to restrict your freedom to share and change those works. By contrast, the DDPL’s first phase—modelled on the spirit of the GNU Affero General Public License—guarantees your freedom to use, study, Modify, and redistribute the software, including when it is deployed over a network. You may charge for copies, combine the software with other projects on the understanding that you make any Modified Source Code available to all recipients and users of the network-deployed version.

When we speak of “freedom,” we mean the ability to obtain Source Code or have it offered to you, to adapt the software or incorporate parts of it into new free programs, and to share those changes under the same terms. Our dual-phase design ensures that, during the copyleft phase, these freedoms are fully protected and that improvements flow back into the commons, encouraging cooperation and mutual benefit.

The DDPL protects user freedoms in two simple steps: (1) it asserts copyright on the work, and (2) applies this License, which grants legal permission to copy, Distribute, and Modify the work under the terms of the initial copyleft phase. This approach helps ensure that, even if code is run on publicly accessible servers, the Modified source remains available to the community.

However, this strong copyleft obligation is not permanent. On a defined conversion date, every work originally released under the DDPL will automatically transition to a more permissive license (with the default license being the MIT License) with the additional benefit of patent licenses inherited from the first phase. From the transition date onward, the software—and any derivative works—may be used, Modified, and re-Distributed with minimal conditions, reflecting a belief that early-stage openness lays the groundwork for widespread adoption and innovation while minimizing risks of vendor lock-in.

The precise terms and conditions governing copying, distribution, Modification, and the automatic transition between phases are as follows:

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 0. Definitions.

"Appropriate Legal Notices" are notices that include a readily accessible and prominently visible feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may Distribute the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. An interface that presents such notice as a prominent item in a list of user commands or options (such as a menu) meets this criterion.

"Contribution" means any original work of authorship—including without limitation source code, object code, documentation, translations, illustrations, and all Intellectual Property submitted by the Contributor for inclusion in, or documentation of, the Program, whether via pull request, patch, email, instant message, or any other means of communication or contribution.

"Contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of a Contribution or a work on which the Contribution is based.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.
"Intellectual Property" means any and all rights in and to inventions, patents, patentable inventions, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, moral rights, database rights, industrial designs, and any other proprietary rights recognized by law, whether registered or unregistered, and including any applications for registration thereof, as well as any derivative works, improvements, or modifications thereto.

"Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the Source Code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to Modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the Source Code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work. The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source. The Corresponding Source for a work in Source Code form is that same work.

"Covered Work" means either the un-Modified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "Distribute" or "Distributing" a work means the Making Available, or any kind of distribution, of such work in a manner that enables third parties to make or receive copies of such work. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not Distributing.

"Private Use Activity" means using the Covered Work, or reproducing/modifying a copy, solely for personal or internal use and without Distributing such copy to a third party.

"Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"License" refers to this version of the Daimon Dual Phase License (DDPL).

"Licensees" and "recipients" means individuals, organizations and any other legal persons.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

To "Make Available" or "Making Available" means any communication to the public of a work, by wire or wireless means, including the making available to the public the work in such a way that members of the public may access such work from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

To "Modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "Modified Version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

The "Source Code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making Modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

"Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language.

"System Libraries" of an executable work means anything, other than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in Source Code form. A "Major Component", in this context, means a major Contribution component (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

### 1. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are, subject to section 7 (Termination; Conversion to Phase 2 License), granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable for such term provided you comply with this License. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the un-Modified Program. The output from running a Covered Work is covered by this License only if the output, given its content, constitutes a Covered Work. This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent rights, as provided by copyright law.

Subject to section 12 (Remote Network Interaction with Modified Versions; Use with earlier versions of the DDPL), you may conduct Private-Use Activities with the Covered Work, without conditions, so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may Distribute Covered Works to others for the sole purpose of having them make Modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in distributing all material for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the Covered Works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

Distributing the Covered Work under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 9 makes it unnecessary.

### 2. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No Covered Work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures.

When you Distribute a Covered Work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to the Covered Work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or Modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures.

### 3. Distributing Verbatim Copies.

You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Program's Source Code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you:

(a) conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;

(b) except for works distributed pursuant to section 4, keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 6 apply to the code; and

(c) keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you Distribute, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

### 4. Distributing Modified Source Versions.

You may Distribute a work based on the Program, or the Modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of Source Code under the terms of section 3, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

(a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you Modified it, and giving a relevant date;

(b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 6. This requirement Modifies the requirement in section 3 to "keep intact all notices";

(c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 6 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it; and

(d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a Covered Work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the Covered Work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a Covered Work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

### 5. Distributing Non-Source Forms.

You may Distribute a Covered Work in object code form under the terms of sections 3 and 4, provided that you also Distribute the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

(a) Distribute the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

(b) Distribute the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this distributing of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

(c) Distribute individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accordance with subsection 5(b).

(d) Distribute the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

(e) Distribute the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 5(b).

A separable portion of the object code, whose Source Code is excluded from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in distributing the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute Modified Versions of a Covered Work in that User Product from a Modified Version of its Corresponding Source. The Installation Information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the Modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because Modification has been made.

If you Distribute an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and the distributing occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the Corresponding Source Distributed under this section must be accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install Modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been Modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been Modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the Modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network.

Corresponding Source Distributed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

### 6. Additional Terms.

"Additional Permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional Permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law. If Additional Permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by this License without regard to the Additional Permissions.

When you Distribute a copy of a Covered Work, you may at your option remove any Additional Permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional Permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you Modify the work.) You may place Additional Permissions on material, added by you to a Covered Work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a Covered Work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

(a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 14 and 15 of this License; or

(b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing it; or

(c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that Modified Versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

(d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or

(e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

(f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who distributes the material (or Modified Versions of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions" within the meaning of section 9. If the Program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or distributing under this License, you may add to a Covered Work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or distributing.

If you add terms to a Covered Work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way.

You acknowledge and agree that Additional Permissions terminate on and from the Conversion Date in accordance with section 7 (Termination; Conversion to Phase 2 License).

### 7. Termination; Conversion to Phase 2 License

#### Termination

You may not Distribute, Make Available or Modify a Covered Work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to Distribute, Make Available or Modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any licenses granted to you under section 10).

However, if you remedy all violations of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the remedying.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated if (i) the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, (ii) this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and (iii) you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 9.

#### Conversion to Phase 2 License

Effective on the Change Date, or, if the Change Date has not been defined, on the third anniversary of the first publicly available distribution of the Program described at the head of this License, this License expires and is substituted on and from the Change Date with the terms of the Change License.

Such expiry of this License does not to apply to section 10 (Contributor License and Consent), section 14 (Disclaimer of Warranty), section 15 (Limitation of Liability) or section 16 (Interpretation of Sections 14 and 15) which, along with their incorporated definitions, will survive and take precedence over anything to the contrary in the Change License.

To the extent the Change License is silent on any issue addressed by those surviving sections, the surviving sections apply as written. By entering into this License, you, Licensees, contributors and recipients acknowledge and agree that your respective rights and obligations will, on and from the Change Date be substituted in the manner and on the terms described in this paragraph.

Any Additional Permissions you added will terminate on and from the Conversion Date unless you expressly re-license them under the Change License.

### 8. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary Distribution or Making Available of a Covered Work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to Distribute, Make Available or Modify any Covered Work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by Modifying, Distributing or Making Available a Covered Work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

### 9. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you Distribute a Covered Work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, Modify, Make Available and Distribute that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations. If Distribution or Making Available of a Covered Work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

### 10. Contributor License and Consent

#### (a) License by Contributors

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license to:

(i)  use, copy, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, Make Available and Distribute your Contributions and such derivative works, in any manner or fashion at the sole and absolute discretion of the Licensor; and

(ii) to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Contribution in any manner the Licensor sees fit, such license applying only to those patent rights and claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of your Contribution(s) with the Covered Work. If any person institutes patent litigation against you or any other person (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that your Contribution, or the Covered Work to which you have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that person under this License for that Contribution or Program shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

#### (b) Moral Rights Consent

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, You waive any moral rights (or, where waiver is not permitted, You irrevocably covenant not to assert such rights) in Your Contribution. You further consent in favour of the Licensor and to all recipients, their respective assignees, successors in title and any person authorised by same that they may carry out any activity, including any acts or omissions to act, in respect of your Contribution, the performance or non-performance of which would otherwise infringe Your moral rights.

#### (c) Representations by You

In submitting a Contribution, you warrant and represent that your Contributions are your original creations, that you are legally entitled to grant the licenses set out in this section 10, and that you have obtained all necessary consents and waivers from 3rd parties required to grant such licenses.

#### (d) Rights not Diminished

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

### 11. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot Distribute a Covered Work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not Distribute it at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further distributing from those to whom you Distribute the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from distributing the Program.

### 12. Remote Network Interaction with Modified Versions; Use with earlier versions of the DDPL.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you Modify the Program, your Modified Version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by any earlier version of the DDPL that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or combine any Covered Work with a work licensed under earlier versions of the DDPL into a single combined work, and to Distribute the resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the Covered Work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by the earlier version of the DDPL.

### 13. Revised Versions of this License.

Daimon Legal may publish revised and/or new versions of the Dual Phase License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the Dual Phase License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by Daimon Legal. If the Program does not specify a version number of the Daimon Dual Phase License, you may choose any version ever published by Daimon Legal.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the Dual Phase License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version.

### 14. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

### 15. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

### 16. Interpretation of Sections 14 and 15.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

---

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notice to the program and the repositories where the program can be found. It is safest to attach it to the start of each source file to increase the visibility of the warranty disclaimers; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice can be found:

```
[insert one line here with the program's name and a brief idea of what it does]

Copyright (C) [year]  [name of author]

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or Modify it under the terms of the Daimon Dual Phase License as published by Daimon Legal, either version 1.0, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but disclaims all WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. This disclaimer covers all warranties, whether express or implied such as (but not limited to) any warranties of MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, and NONINFRINGEMENT. See the Daimon Dual Phase License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the Daimon Dual Phase License along with this program.  If not, see https://github.com/Daimon-Law/Daimon-Dual-Phase-License
```
